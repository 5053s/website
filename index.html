                    Our members work in all sorts of positions in tech companies,
                    (from marketing to programming and more), as well as those who are interested in
                    joining the field. Though we have events in the Bay Area and LA, there are members across
                    the globe; we also share events that take place nationwide, and are open to starting new local
                    communities.
