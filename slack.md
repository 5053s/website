Slack is a great way for the community to stay in touch, in this page we included some information
that will make your slack experience better.

First of all, we have a [code of conduct](http://techqueria.org/code-of-conduct/), in short, be respectful
of everyone and their identity. Disrespectful behavior is not accepted. If you feel that someone is breaking
the code of conduct [contact us](http://techqueria.org/contact/) and we will try to sort it out.

If this is your first time using slack  and want to learn more about it, start
[https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users](here).

We have customized a few things about our slack to make communications better, we have bots, custom emoji,
special commands and channels to make communication better.

# Public Channels

We have created different channels to keep conversations relevant. Those channels are not joined by deault, you can
click on *CHANNELS* to see a list of all the channels and join the ones you want.

## Location Channels

We have a few location channels, like `#sf`, `#chicago`, `#nyc`, `#la`, `#sandiego`, and you can create new ones.
Use them to communicate with folks in those locations, whether you live there or are planning on visiting it can
be a great resource.

## Topic channels

We have some great conversations about `#comida`, `#musica`, `#futbol`, `#politica`, `#memes` and other
topics in their respective channels.
`#random` is used for conversations that don't particularly fit in any place, but could be relevant for everyone.

# Private channels

We have a few private channels for conversations that you don't want everyone to see, we're using a system created by
[http://wealljs.org/](WeAllJS) to manage the participation in those.

To see a list of available channels, run the command `/list-private`, to request an invitation to a channel you're
interested in, use the command `/join-private` with the channel name.

# Emojis

When you click on the emoji icon in the conversation or to add a reaction, you can see a ton of custom ones we've added.
You can find images for things like arepa, empanada, baseball teams, avocado, etc. Take a look at them and enjoy! and feel
free to [https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206870177-Create-custom-emoji](add more).

# Contact us

If you want to messsage the moderators for whatever reason, to say hi, request an invite, send us flowers or anything, use
the following command `/admin` followed by your message.

If you'd like to participate in the conversation about the future of the community, event planning, suggest speakers
and be more involved, join the channel `#meta`.
