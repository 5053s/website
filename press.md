## The Tech Industry’s Leaky Pipeline

Dec 16, 2016 **Latino Usa** by [Antonia Cerejido](https://twitter.com/antoniacere)

No matter the measure, whether it be race, class, or gender, the tech industry
does not reflect the American work horse. Most industry leaders, including
Google and Facebook, see the lack of diversity as a problem, and one of the
most common diagnoses is what is called “the pipeline.” The idea is that there
aren’t enough qualified candidates from underrepresented groups to hire because
they aren’t being prepared for careers in tech.
