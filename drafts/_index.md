## Event Types

### Networking

Our most informal type of event are just Techqueria members gathering together to network and hang out casually. Examples include happy hours, board game nights, etc.

### Panels

Our panel events allow participants to discuss their work, prepare for critical milestones in their career, establish goals and accountability through peer mentorship, and explore how to navigate our workplaces as underrepresented members of the tech industry.

There are usually 3 to 4 panelists with 1 moderator.

### Comida

Outside our regular workshops and meetups, we often meet up and network at food gathering events that we call comidas. This is an opportunity to share our rich, diverse cultures through food and fun! Anyone in our community can organize a comida and a company can also sponsor one for up to 25 people.

### Webinar

Gain exposure to a wider audience beyond one night and be inclusive of remote employees or attendees outside our chapter locations. Through a webinar, we will stream your event through YouTube and extend your reach.

### ERG Leads Unite Meetings

Local Latinx ERG leads get together and share struggles and advice.

### Hackathons

Hackathons allow Techqueria members to collaborate intensively on projects they're passionate about.

### Lightning Talks

Host lightning talk events where 10+ people give 5 minute rapid style presentaitons.

### Workshops

Host a private workshop or community event at your company where we discuss a specific topic. Previous topics have included coaching on executive presence and public speaking, building effective employee resource groups, and navigating the workplace as an individual contributor.
