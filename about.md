Latin@s in Tech - Bay Area is a group interested in connecting folks from underrepresented backgrounds in tech, particularly those from the Latinx community.

Join us to keep posted on the latest events relevant to inclusion and diversity in the tech field. We welcome those from all positions within the tech industry (from marketing to programming and more), as well as those who are interested in joining the field. Though our events are Bay Area-based, we welcome members from across the globe.  While many of our events are California-centered (both NorCal and SoCal), we also share events that take place nationwide.  Come share your experiences with the community.
