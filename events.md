### Latinos In Tech <small>Getting beyond the 3%</small>
**March 28 - Oakland**

California—the San Francisco Bay Area in particular—is a global hub for
high-tech innovation and by 2020 there will be one million high-paying software
jobs unfilled across the county. Unfortunately, only 54% of Latino families in
California have internet access at home and only 3% of high-tech industry
employees are Latino. How can we change this reality?

**Panelists:**
- (Moderator) Alberto Melgoza, Financial Systems Lead at Google, founding member of Latinos in Tech Giving Circle
- Jacob Martinez, Founder & Executive Director of Digital NEST, Latinos in Tech Grantee
- Ashleigh Richelle, Communications Manager/Alumni, Level Playing Field Institute (SMASH)
- Diana Albaran Chicas, Co-Founder and Program Director of LISTAS
