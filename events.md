# Events

## Open-Source and CyberSecurity

In our January event, hosted by GitHub, we wanted to especially profile the innovative open-source work being undertaken by underrepresented groups in tech. We'll also have a cybersecurity component to our talks, as we believe in making the web more secure for everyone.
