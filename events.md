### Data Science: From Machine Learning to Algorithm Accountability <small>Sept 28</small>

In September, our event will center on the field of Data Science. Often defined
as a bridge between statistics and programming, Data Science can help improve
procedures for solving a problem, though it also has its challenges. Our talks
will explore recurring themes in machine learning, as well as their wider
social implications.

Join us in the Lumosity Headquarters in San Francisco, meet some fellow
latinxs, grab some food and drinks, and learn about data science.
