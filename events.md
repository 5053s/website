## Plan for the future

In light of recent political events, Techqueria and PyLadies are committed to ensuring that underrepresented groups in tech feel included, valued, and safe.  

Our lives are enriched when everyone is heard and gets to thrive and, more than ever, we need to work together to make sure this remains a priority in the work we all do. This event is a discussion about we can to do support each other. Let's share resources and knowledge and brainstorm for a movement for inclusion in tech and beyond. All are welcome.

For this event, we plan to have break into groups to plan for skill-sharing and event planning for now and the future.
