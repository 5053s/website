# [Lightning Talks and Year in Review](https://www.meetup.com/Latinos-in-Tech-Bay-Area/events/235254289/)

Join Techqueria on Tuesday, November 15 to celebrate our first anniversary!  

In November, our event will showcase the talents of our membership. We'll start off with lightning tech talks on an assortment of topics, including presentations on overloading operators in Python (and an emoji-based script), Ada Lovelace, the React framework and Introductionary Design Concepts.

Our speakers will include Jessica Earley, Patricia Arbona, Dalia Icedo, Kevin Hernandez, and more. 

Then we'll discuss the history of Techqueria and break into discussion groups on how we can strengthen our community even more. We pride ourselves in being a peer mentorship network for Latinxs and other underrepresented groups in tech. We'd love your feedback on how we can improve and make bigger strides towards inclusion.

All, including allies, are welcome. The event is open to the public.

Special thanks to our host, Hackbright Academy, for welcoming us into their space!
