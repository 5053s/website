<strong>Sami Nerenberg</strong> has been teaching design in higher education for the last eight years at Northwestern University, 
Pratt, and the Rhode Island School of Design. She is currently the executive director of the Alliance for Community Development and is
the previous associate director of Design for America. 
Sami believes that as humans we surround ourselves with designed objects, spaces and experiences that reflect our past, present, or aspirations for the future. Her dream would be for all services to be as simple, beautiful, and intuitive as possible.
