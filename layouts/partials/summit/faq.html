        <h3 class="has-text-weight-medium">Do speakers receive an honorarium?</h3>

          Yes, of course. We value the time and effort it takes to create engaging content for our attendees to interact with. The honorarium will
          most likely be $50 for panelists and $100 for those who are the sole speaker for their session but this isn't final yet.
