<p><a href="/">Techqueria</a> is a nonprofit that serves the largest community of Latinx in Tech.</p>
<p>We build Latinx-centered spaces that revolve around career advice, technical talks, mentorship, open jobs, upcoming events/conferences, speaking opportunities, and open-source.</p>
<p>We come from all walks of life and believe that the diversity of our community is the most reliable asset we have.</p>
<p>Our space aims to be inclusive so we invite Latinx from the regions of the Caribbean, Haiti, and Brazil as well as those who identify as Afro-Latinx or LGBTQ. The term Latinx is used instead of Latino or Latina because it is a gender-neutral and inclusive term.</p>
<p>The group began as a Meetup in Silicon Valley in November 2015 with only 3 people attending and has since expanded to New York City, Austin, Los Angeles, and Chicago to connect and support Latinx professionals in those cities.</p>
<!-- TODO: Add patreon supporters to patreon page so it is a relative link -->
<p>Since then, we have grown to have ~4,000 members in our Slack community, ~6,000 through <a href="/newsletter/">our newsletter</a>, numerous supporters <a href="https://www.patreon.com/techqueria" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Patreon</a>, and thousands of followers on social media through Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.</p>
<p>We have also partnered with various organizations to sponsor our events and software such as 1Password, Dropbox, Uber, Stripe, Spotify, Digital Ocean, GitHub, Google and <a href="/supporters/">many others</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our vision is to become the largest network of Latinx in Tech across the country.</p>
