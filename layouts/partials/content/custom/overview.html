<p><a href="/">Techqueria</a> is a nonprofit that empowers Latinx professionals in the tech industry by building networking and career advancement opportunities.</p>
<p>We build Latinx-centered spaces that revolve around career advice, technical talks, mentorship, open jobs, networking events, speaking opportunities, and open-source and we work with both employee resource groups (ERGs) and tech companies to comprehensively affect change in the tech industry.</p>
<p>Coming from all walks of life, we believe that the diversity of our community is the most reliable asset we have. Our space aims to be inclusive so we invite Latinx from the regions of the Caribbean, Haiti, and Brazil as well as those who identify as Afro-Latinx, Asian-Latinx or LGBTQIA. The term Latinx is used instead of Latino or Latina because it is a gender-neutral and inclusive term.</p>
