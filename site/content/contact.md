## Partnering

We're always looking for partners and sponsors to help move our mission forward! We can help promote your event to a latinx audience, find volunteers for different activities, or design programs together that can benefit the community.

We are looking for speakers, locations for our events, sponsors for programs for our members, food, services and merchandise, and we're open to other partnering ideas.

In return we can provide a spotlight for your organization in our events and networks.

You can email us at [organizers@techqueria.org](mailto:organizers@techqueria.org), or using the contact feature in [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/techqueria/)

## Feedback - Code of Conduct Reports

We're always listening to your feedback and ready to help in any way we can.

Use the command `/admin` in the slack to get in touch with us the quicker, or send us an email to [organizers@techqueria.org](mailto:organizers@techqueria.org).

If you need an invitation to Slack, request it [our own Slack welcome page](/slack/).

## Meet us!
