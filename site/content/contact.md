## Partnering

We're always looking for [partners and sponsors](/sponsors/) to help move our mission forward! We can help promote your event to a Latinx audience, find volunteers for different activities, or design programs together that can benefit the community.

We are looking for speakers, locations for our events, those who can sponsors programs for our members, food, services, merchandise and we're open to other partnering ideas.

In return, we can provide a spotlight for your organization in our events and networks.

You can email us at [organizers@techqueria.org](mailto:organizers@techqueria.org), or use the contact feature in [our Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/techqueria/).

## Meet Us In Person

We usually host an event per month, so you are also welcome to connect with us at our various panels and talks in-person.

See our [Communities](/communities/) page for links to our social media groups and to keep informed on what we're doing.

We also like to help other groups with their events and ideas.

Connect and share what you're working on with us!

## Feedback

We're always listening to your feedback and ready to help in any way we can.

Use the command `/admin` in the Slack workspace to get in touch with us the quicker, or send us an email to [organizers@techqueria.org](mailto:organizers@techqueria.org).
