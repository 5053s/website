# Techqueria is a professional space for all members of our growing community.

We believe in respect, compassion, understanding, and inclusion and expect all community members to act on these values.

We have no tolerance for any form of harassment; we expect everyone to act professionally and to follow the social norms of the community.

## Not Allowed

- Spamming the group and excessive self-promotion
- Finding loopholes in the code of conduct
- Any action that results in complaints from our community

### Harassment

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to a person's identity
- Unwelcome remarks regarding a person‚Äôs lifestyle choices and practices
- Unwelcome physical contact
- Threats of violence
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
- Deliberate intimidation
- Exclusionary jokes or comments
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- Deliberate ‚Äúouting‚Äù of any aspect of a person‚Äôs identity
- Sustained disruption of event programming

### Alcohol

For all official Techqueria events, in instances where alcohol is present, the following is required:

- All attendees must have IDs checked to confirm they are 21+
- Alcohol consumption must be limited. Local chapters maintain autonomy for how to implement alcohol control measures (drink tickets, wristbands, etc)
- Additionally, it is at the local chapter‚Äôs discretion how to handle alcohol at casual events

## Handling Violations

A staff member will approach anyone identified as participating in harassing behavior and asked to cease any inappropriate activity or to disengage from our community immediately.

Respect is essential for everybody so if you feel uncomfortable, or suspect of someone's behavior, approach one of the organizers and staff members, we will handle it with confidentiality and care.

Witch-hunting and shaming someone the actions of someone else is also in violation.
