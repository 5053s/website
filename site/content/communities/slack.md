</div>

In the meantime, feel free to check out [our different Community groups](/communities/) and review the overview we've provided of our Slack group below.

We have customized a few things about our slack to make communications better; we have bots, custom emoji, custom commands and channels to make communication better.

## New to Slack?

We use [Aloha](https://aloha.ftw.nyc) for on-boarding which automatically sends new members Slack messages at certain times upon joining the Techqueria Workspace.

> Immediately

All participants in the Techqueria Slack are required to comply with the following code of conduct - make sure to read through it! 🌻

https://techqueria.org/code-of-conduct.

If you have questions, comments or concerns - reach out using the `/admin` command or send an email to `organizers@techqueria.org`.

...

Bienvenidx a Techqueria! 🌮

We're a community of Latinx professionals in the tech industry.

You can find more information about us at https://techqueria.org.

> 5 minutes after joining

Now that you're situated, go ahead and introduce yourself in the `#introductions` channel so we can all get to know who you are! 🎉

As part of onboarding, we'd also love it if you uploaded a profile photo 🖼️ and filled out your profile on Slack.

> 15 minutes after joining

Here's a link to our Slack Community Guidelines that will help you get started! 📝️

https://techqueria.org/slack

> 1 hour after joining

We do our best to cut down on interruptions 🔕

- Please avoid using `@channel` mentions whenever possible (you can use `@here` instead to notify desktop users).
- If you need someone's attention, it's usually better to _mention them in a public channel_ instead of sending a private message whenever possible.
- Use threads for deeper discussions around specific topics or posts without clogging the rest of the channel.

### Slack Demo

Here's [a demo](https://slackdemo.com) of how Slack works!

[![Slack Demo](https://i.imgur.com/o2ZWFGt.jpg)](https://slackdemo.com)

### Slack Foundry

[Slack Foundry](https://slackfoundry.builtbyslack.com/) is a training app for Slack that you can access (you guessed it!) in Slack.

[![Slack Foundry](https://i.imgur.com/RxwMHdC.jpg)](https://slackfoundry.builtbyslack.com/)

### Getting Started Guide

Slack's [Getting Started Guide](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/360000049043-Getting-Started) covers the basics and is the official documentation provided by Slack.

[![Getting Started Guide](https://i.imgur.com/pVQbhkX.jpg)](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/360000049043-Getting-Started)

## Code of Conduct

You can find our code of conduct at [https://techqueria.org/code-of-conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

In short, this is a professional community so be respectful of everyone and their identity.

Unprofessional behavior is **not** acceptable so if you feel that someone is breaking the code of conduct, make sure to [contact us](/contact/) and we will sort it out.

## Channels

### Default Channels

There are three default channels everyone automatically gets added to upon joining.

- `#admin-announcements`
  - locked to the organizers - this is where admins/organizers will post news and information about the community at large
- `#jobs`
  - sharing and requesting job opportunities
- `#random`
  - conversations that don't fit in any topic channel but could be relevant for everyone

### Public Channels

We have created different channels to keep conversations relevant, e.g.

- `#comida`
- `#front-end`
- `#futbol`
- `#javascript`
- `#memes`
- `#mentoring`
- `#musica`
- `#open-source`
- `#politica`

By default, you do not join those channels but you can click on _CHANNELS_ to see a list of all the channels and join the ones that seem the most interesting.

We monitor most activity in those channels to make sure content is relevant so if something off-topic is posted there, we might move it to a more appropriate channel.

#### Location Channels

We have a few location channels that are prefixed with `locals`, e.g.

- `#locals-atl`
- `#locals-austin`
- `#locals-boston`
- `#locals-chicago`
- `#locals-la`
- `#locals-nyc`
- `#locals-philly`
- `#locals-sandiego`
- `#locals-sf`

You can use these channels to communicate with folks in those locations, whether you live there or visiting it can be a great resource.

You can contact the admins to get new location channels created.

### Private Channels

We have a few private channels for conversations that you don't want everyone to see, and we're using a system created by [WeAllJs](https://wealljs.org) to manage the participation of those.

To see a list of available channels, run the command `/list-private`, and click on the join button to request an invitation.

![Private List](/assets/img/slack/private-list.png)

<!-- As of December 2018, these are all the private channels.

- `#` -->

## Best Practices

### Use threads

This convo in the `#website` channel could have been 28 separate messages! 🤯

Instead, with threads - it turned into a more rich and focused discussion. 😌

### Channel naming conventions

- Locations
  - `#locals-`
- Website
  - `#website-`
- Teams
  - `#team-`
- Projects
  - `#proj-`
- Support
  - `#help-`

### Mentions

- Please avoid using `@channel` mentions whenever possible (you can use `@here` instead to notify desktop users).
- If you need someone's attention, it's usually better to _mention them in a public channel_ instead of sending a private message whenever possible.

## Sidebar Theme

Copy and paste these values to your settings [Sidebar Theme](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205166337-Customizing-your-Slack-theme) section to get Techqueria theming.

`#FFFFFF,#FFFFFF,#FBAE52,#000000,#FBAE52,#000000,#FF551F,#FF551F`

## Emojis

When you click on the emoji icon in the conversation or to add a reaction, you can see a ton of custom ones we've added. 🎉

You can find images for things like arepa, empanada, baseball teams, avocado, etc.

Take a look at them and feel free to [add more custom emoji](https://latinos.slack.com/customize/emoji) yourself.

![Empanada](https://i.imgur.com/2lUgWs2.jpg)
