## Waiting for Invitation

As you are waiting for your Slack invite, feel free to check out [our different Community groups](/communities/) and the details we've provided about our Slack group below.

You should get an invite within 2 weeks. If you don't get an invite by then, please email us at `organizers@techqueria.org`.

## Code of Conduct

You can find our code of conduct at [https://techqueria.org/code-of-conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

In short, this is a professional community so be respectful of everyone and their identity.

Unprofessional behavior is **not** acceptable so if you feel that someone is breaking the code of conduct, make sure to contact an admin and we will sort it out.

You can contact and admin by using the command `/admin` in Slack followed by your message.

## Channels

### Default Channels

There are three default channels everyone automatically gets added to upon joining.

- `#admin-announcements`
  - locked to the organizers - this is where admins/organizers will post news and information about the community at large
- `#jobs`
  - sharing and requesting job opportunities
- `#random`
  - conversations that don't fit in any topic channel but could be relevant for everyone

### Public Channels

We have created different channels to keep conversations relevant, e.g.

- `#comida`
- `#front-end`
- `#futbol`
- `#javascript`
- `#memes`
- `#mentoring`
- `#musica`
- `#open-source`
- `#politica`

By default, you do not join those channels but you can click on _CHANNELS_ to see a list of all the channels and join the ones that seem the most interesting.

We monitor most activity in those channels to make sure content is relevant so if something off-topic is posted there, we might move it to a more appropriate channel.

### Location Based Channels

We have a few location channels that are prefixed with `#locals-`.

For example:

- `#locals-atl`
- `#locals-austin`
- `#locals-boston`
- `#locals-chicago`
- `#locals-la`
- `#locals-nyc`
- `#locals-philly`
- `#locals-sandiego`
- `#locals-sf`

You can use these channels to communicate with folks in those locations, whether you live there or visiting it can be a great resource.

You can contact the admins to get new location channels created.

### Private Channels

We have a few private channels for conversations that you don't want everyone to see, and we're using a system created by [WeAllJs](https://wealljs.org) to manage the participation of those.

To see a list of available channels, run the command `/list-private`, and click on the join button to request an invitation.

![Private List](/assets/img/slack/private-list.png)

### Meta

If you'd like to participate in the conversation about the future of the community, event planning, suggest speakers and be more involved, you can join these channels.

- `#meta`
  - Give feedback about how we run Slack or events
- `#twitter`
  - Automated feed of Twitter account activity
    - https://twitter.com/TechqueriaSF
    - https://twitter.com/TechqueriaNYC
    - https://twitter.com/TechqueriaLA
- `#website`
  - Discussing & contributing to Techqueria website https://techqueria.org
- `#website-github`
  - Automated activity feed from https://github.com/techqueria/website

### Requesting A Channel

Not finding a channel you want? No worries, head on over to `#request-a-channel` to request the creation, archival or deletion of a channel.

## Best Practices

### Use threads

This convo in the `#website` channel could have been 28 separate messages! ü§Ø

Instead, with threads - it turned into a more rich and focused discussion. üòå

![Threads](https://i.imgur.com/H9KWoqD.jpg)

### Channel naming conventions

- Locations
  - `#locals-`
- Website
  - `#website-`
- Teams
  - `#team-`
- Projects
  - `#proj-`
- Support
  - `#help-`

### Mentions

- Please avoid using `@channel` mentions whenever possible (you can use `@here` instead to notify desktop users).
- If you need someone's attention, it's usually better to _mention them in a public channel_ instead of sending a private message whenever possible.

## Customization

All these customization suggestions are completely optional and solely meant to improve your experience using Techqueria's Slack.

### HeyTaco!

The HeyTaco! bot sparks conversations and builds stronger relationships with its fun and unique kindness currency... tacos! üåÆ

Their model fits perfectly with Techqueria's brand so we were so glad when the founders decided to offer us a community discount, making it completely free for all 3000+ of our Slack members when it usually costs \$2 bucks per person per month. ü§Ø

You can learn more about HeyTaco! at [https://www.heytaco.chat](https://www.heytaco.chat)

#### How @heytaco works üìå

You can use @heytaco to give someone a üåÆ when you'd like to show praise, appreciation, or to add a little happiness to their day. `:hey-taco:`

**1**. Every person in our Slack Workspace has 5 tacos to give out per day

- üåÆ x 5Ô∏è‚É£

**2**. To give someone a taco, add a taco emoji after their username

- Like this: `@username your positive attitude was a real help today! :taco:`

![HeyTaco! Examples](/assets/img/slack/hey-taco-examples.png)

**3**. You can give tacos to anyone on your team as long as the bot has been invited to the channel

- You can invite the bot to channels using `/invite @heytaco`

**4**. There is a leaderboard to see who is getting the most tacos

- Anyone in our Slack Workspace can sign in and see the leaderboard using [https://www.heytaco.chat/leaderboard](https://www.heytaco.chat/leaderboard)

**5**. Need help?

- If you need help, you can just DM `@heytaco` the word `help` and it will assist you.

### Sidebar Theme

### Custom Status

Something fun we do in Techqueria's Slack is [setting a custom status](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201864558-Set-your-Slack-status-and-availability) with a flag representing our Latinx heritage/background.

![Custom Status Edit](/assets/img/slack/custom-status-edit.png)

![Custom Status Hover](/assets/img/slack/custom-status-hover.png)

If you want to put multiple flags, you can do that too!

![Custom Status Hover](/assets/img/slack/custom-status-multiple-flags.png)

### Emojis

When you click on the emoji icon in the conversation or to add a reaction, you can see a ton of custom ones we've added. üéâ

You can find images for things like arepa, empanada, baseball teams, avocado, etc.

Take a look at them and feel free to [add more custom emoji](https://latinos.slack.com/customize/emoji) yourself.
