In the meantime, feel free to check out [our different Community groups](/communities/) and review the overview we've provided of our Slack group below.

We have customized a few things about our slack to make communications better; we have bots, custom emoji, custom commands and channels to make communication better.

## Code of Conduct

First of all, we have a [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct/), in short, this is a professional community, be respectful of everyone and their identity.

Unprofessional behavior is not accepted.

If you feel that someone is breaking the code of conduct, make sure to [contact us](/contact/) and we will sort it out.

If this is your first time using Slack and want to learn more about how to use it, feel free to look over [Slack's Getting Started pages](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users).

## Public Channels

We have created different channels to keep conversations relevant.

By default, you do not join those channels but you can click on _CHANNELS_ to see a list of all the channels and join the ones that seem the most interesting.

### Default Channels

There are three default channels:

- `#admin-announcements`
  - locked to the organizers, is where we post news and information about the community and future events
- `#jobs`
  - sharing and requesting job opportunities
- `#random`
  - conversations that don't fit in any topic channel, but could be relevant for everyone

We monitor most activity in those channels to make sure content is relevant so if something off-topic is posted there, we might move it to a more appropriate channel.

### Location Channels

We have a few location channels that are prefixed with `locals`, e.g.

- `#locals-sf`
- `#locals-chicago`
- `#locals-nyc`
- `#locals-la`
- `#locals-sandiego`

You can use these channels to communicate with folks in those locations, whether you live there or visiting it can be a great resource.

You can contact the admins to get new location channels created.

### Topic Channels

We have some great conversations about `#comida`, `#musica`, `#futbol`, `#politica`, `#memes`, `#mentoring` and other topics in their respective channels.

## Private Channels

We have a few private channels for conversations that you don't want everyone to see, and we're using a system created by [WeAllJs](http://wealljs.org) to manage the participation of those.

To see a list of available channels, run the command `/list-private`, and click on the join button to request an invitation.

## Emojis

When you click on the emoji icon in the conversation or to add a reaction, you can see a ton of custom ones we've added. ðŸŽ‰

You can find images for things like arepa, empanada, baseball teams, avocado, etc.

Take a look at them and feel free to [add more](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206870177-Create-custom-emoji).

## Meta

If you'd like to participate in the conversation about the future of the community, event planning, suggest speakers and be more involved, join the channel `#meta`.

## Contact Admins

If you want to message the moderators for whatever reason, to say hi, request an invite, send us flowers or anything, use the following command `/admin` followed by your message.
