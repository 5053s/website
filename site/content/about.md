## Who we are

We're a professional community for Latinxs in tech.

Techqueria is a space where we can network and advance in our careers, bring access to tech for low-income communities and increase the opportunities for us in tech.

We come from all walks of life and believe that the diversity of the community is our most reliable asset.

We promote collaboration among our members and aim to create a culture where we are continually looking for ways to uplift each other.

## What we do

We maintain online communities to hold conversations around different topics that are valuable for the community; career advice, work opportunities, events, resources and even where to get great food!

We meet for events in our different chapters, usually with speakers or a panel to both learn something new and have the opportunity to network and create stronger bonds.

We create partnerships with other organizations and communities; both those that provide value to our members or to those that we can volunteer and help them get closer to their goals.

## Team

Techqueria is possible thanks to the work of lots of people, organizers, volunteers, mentors, sponsors, and advisors; and we're thankful for all of them.
