## Who we are

We're a professional community for Latinxs in tech.

Techqueria is a space where we can network and advance in our careers, work on open-source together, and help Latinx workers across the industry.

We come from all walks of life and believe that the diversity of the community is our most reliable asset.

We promote collaboration among our members and aim to create a culture where we are continually looking for ways to uplift each other.

## What we do

We maintain online communities to hold conversations around different topics that are valuable for the community; career advice, work opportunities, events,resources and even where to get great food!

We meet for events in our different chapters, usually with speakers on a panel to learn, network, and create stronger bonds.

We create partnerships with other organizations and communities that advance our mission.
