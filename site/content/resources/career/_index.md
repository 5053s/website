## Slack

Within the Techqueria community, we provide different resources to help our members advance their careers, whether it is to find a new job, negotiate, practice for interviews or find new employees.

To join our Slack team, you can request an invite to your email [on our Slack welcome page](/communities/slack/) and then you can participate with your smartphone or computer.

If you haven't used Slack before, take a look at these [Getting Started pages](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users) where they explain how to take advantage of all the features.

In Slack, we have a channel titled `#jobs` that hosts all these discussions.

## LinkedIn

There's a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13500636) group to post about job offers, recommendations, and get information to advance your career.

## Meetups

We hold events around once a month through [our Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/techqueria/) in the Bay Area, these events are an excellent opportunity to make new friends and connections, to help you land a job, and for some Meetups, we have coding workshops or training related t0 career progress.
