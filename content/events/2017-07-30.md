About event:

Join us for a day of music, food, and fun at John McLaren Park in San Francisco with fellow Techqueria members!

We will be grilling some meat and veggies. We want it to be a potluck style event, so if you have any food to share please bring some! Y si tienen musica tambien traiganla para bailar :D!

As per park regulations, no hard alcohol but beer and wine are welcome.

RSVP here on Eventbrite and follow us on twitter @techqueriaSFto get details on where we’ll gather at the park. We are trying to get a spot near parking spaces for those that will be driving.

For those who haven’t joined our Techqueria Slack check us out at https://techqueria.org/slack/ and join the #locals-sf channel to connect with the latinx in tech community in San Francisco.
