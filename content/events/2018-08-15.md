Join us for a night of networking and learning about what it means to be on the frontlines of EdTech!

Informed K12 is an impact-driven EdTech company that partners with school districts to automate their paper processes so that districts can spend more time building capacity, and less time doing day-to-day administrative work. Informed K12â€™s staff is passionate about diversity and inclusion and is excited to partner with Techqueria to host an evening of great conversation, and new connections.

Sit in on a panel of different folks across the EdTech space and learn about how they paved their path to EdTech, build products in the educational sector, and continually learn from challenges and highlights as their companies scale.
