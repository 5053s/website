Hola!

Techqueria and Latinas in Tech would like invite you to an evening of new friends, drinks, and food.

Today, there are several Latinx organizations and community leaders in NYC but we don't often get the opportunity to collaborate and share our projects. The goal of this gathering is to come together to brainstorm ideas to strengthen our community, promote latinx talent, and work together more effectively.

We're inviting Latinx leaders, including startup founders, mentors and community organizers who are deeply involved in organizations that build and support our community. We hope this night serves as the beginning of new friendships and alliances. This is a unique gathering of around 50 Latinx leaders in the tech field. We hope you can join us.
