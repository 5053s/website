## Core Sponsorship Tiers

The primary way we partner with tech companies is through corporate partnerships.

We have recommended some base sponsorship packages below but we are also open to [custom packages](/support-us/corporate-partner/custom-packages/) which range from from $100 to $150,000 so there are options for companies of all sizes.

Techqueria events are virtual instead of in-person indefinitely until further notice due to COVID-19.

We also price virutal events as 50% off.

## Event Types

### Networking

Our most informal type of event are just Techqueria members gathering together to network and hang out casually. Examples include happy hours, board game nights, etc.

### Panels

Our panel events allow participants to discuss their work, prepare for critical milestones in their career, establish goals and accountability through peer mentorship, and explore how to navigate our workplaces as underrepresented members of the tech industry.

There are usually 3 to 4 panelists with 1 moderator.

### Comida

Outside our regular workshops and meetups, we often meet up and network at food gathering events that we call comidas. This is an opportunity to share our rich, diverse cultures through food and fun! Anyone in our community can organize a comida and a company can also sponsor one for up to 25 people.

### Webinar

Gain exposure to a wider audience beyond one night and be inclusive of remote employees or attendees outside our chapter locations. Through a webinar, we will stream your event through YouTube and extend your reach.

### ROI & Metrics

We've created **[a detailed document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aZZA7UU5TsA_s_yGVZQMS10H7Nl1OKi9hYuJYRhc-3M/edit)** outlining the ROI and overall metrics for CTAs on email & social media.

### Cost

We charge $100 for every call to action shared through our email newsletter or through our social media accounts.

### Process

Make sure to include relevant wording and links so we can craft the message to your liking.

### Disclaimers

- We post 1 CTA across all 6 of our major social media platforms so we don't post the CTA multiple times throughout the month, just once if you purchased the 1 call to action per month package.
- We have corporate partnerships where we offer both event + marketing packages. In those types of partnerships, companies where they are responsible for providing us specific job postings if they want to promote those, otherwise we default to the general careers link.
- We haven't researched whether there is a huge difference in clicks between posting a generic career link or a specific job posting but we prefer to promote specific job postings.
- The job section in email newsletter is also dependent on if the companies provide us specific job postings and affects the format.
- We do not allow for refunds so please be sure of your purchase.
- **Techqueria has a [strict policy](/about/no-tech-for-ice/) in place to not partner with companies that have an active contract with ICE.**
