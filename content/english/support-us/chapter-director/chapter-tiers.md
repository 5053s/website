## More Info On Reimbursement

- Max Stipend Per Year is calculated
    - Yearly Misc Expenses + Event Reimbursement * Max # of Events + (Director Reimbursement * Max # of Events * 2 directors)
- Event Reimbursements
    - Events must have at least 20 people in attendance in order to get full event reimbursement depending on chapter tier
    - If the number of attendees is 50 or more, event reimbursement go up by $1 for every additional person and director reimbursement goes up by $0.50 for every additional person
        - i.e. tier 1 chapter event has base of $300 and has 100 attendees ‚Äî max reimbursement is $300 + $1*50 or $350 and each director is allowed up to a $75 stipend
        - i.e. tier 2 chapter event has base of $250 and has 100 attendees ‚Äî max reimbursement is $250 + $1 * 50 or $300 and each director is allowed up to a $50 stipend
        - i.e. tier 3 chapter event has base of $200 and has 100 attendees ‚Äî max reimbursement is $200 + $1 * 50 or $250 and each director is allowed up to a $25 stipend
        - TODO: Create a calculator calculating potential reimbursement for extremely large events
    - For events with 10 to 19 people, up to $75 can be reimbursed
    - For events with 9 or less attendees, no reimbursements are provided so we recommend always having events that include at least 10 people
    - Attendees can include chapter directors and speakers
    - All attendance must be verified via Bevy before reimbursement is provided
    - Reimbursements must only be used to cover out of pocket costs for events, must be approved through Open Collective and must adhere to the Reimbursement Policy
- Director Reimbursement
    - Chapter Directors are still considered volunteers legally and therefore cannot receive more than $600 in stipend per year for legal purposes.
        - Businesses use [IRS Form W-9](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9), Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, to get information from vendors they hire as independent contractors (also called freelancers). When a business pays a contractor $600 or more during a tax year, it has to report these payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), using an information return called Form 1099-MISC. Businesses use the name, address, and Social Security number or tax identification number contractors provide on Form W-9 to complete that information return. Neither the sender nor the recipient should send a copy to the IRS.
    - Max 2 Chapter Directors Per Chapter for Stipends
        - A chapter can have as many directors as needed but stipend cannot exceed two directors.
- Misc Expenses
    - Examples: Thanking volunteers through lunches or dinners, travel costs for conferences where Techqueria is a partner, extra budget for events
    - Reimbursements must only be used to benefit the Techqueria chapter, must be approved through Open Collective and must adhere to the Reimbursement Policy
- Monetary Event Sponsors
    - If an event gets sponsored by a company and the chapter receives money, 80% of that money must go towards Techqueria but the remaining 20% can be spent in chapter budget.
        - For example, if the SF chapter receives a $5,000 sponsorship ‚Äî¬†$4,000 goes to Techqueria and $1,000 goes towards to SF chapter budget.
