## Legal Compliance

Reimbursements made under an "accountable plan" as defined by the IRS allow Techqueria to reimburse our employees or volunteers for business-related expenses without including the expenses in their compensation, which might be subject to payroll taxes.

In addition, employees or volunteers won't have to report the payments with their taxable income.

To follow legal procedures for submitting expenses,

- Expenses must be related to your nonprofit
- The employee or volunteer must account for the expenses within 60 days of incurring the expense
- The employee or volunteer must return any excess reimbursement no more than 120 days after receipt

### What You Can Reimburse

- good food and drinks for attendees a the event (tacos are a good first choice ðŸ˜‰)
- transit costs to get to a conference where Techqueria has a booth
    - shared ride, parking, public transportation
- materials for events
    - stickers
    - banners
    - swag
- speaker payments/fees
- fun event activity
    - photo booth
    - crafting
- thank you dinners or lunches for volunteers

### What You Cannot Reimburse

- transit cost for a Techqueria event
- private dinners with partners
- stipend for chapter directors
    - chapter director roles are unpaid unless otherwise noted in Chapter Tier benefits, in which case, there is a separate stipend that is used to pay that
- stipend for volunteers
    - volunteer roles are unpaid
- software or online platforms

## How to Request Reimbursement

1. Go to [https://opencollective.com/techqueria](https://opencollective.com/techqueria)
2. Sign up or login to Open Collective [https://opencollective.com](https://opencollective.com/)
3. Submit an expense and verify all 4 points below are covered:
    1. **Who incurred the expense?**Â Payment will be issued to this person.
    2. **What was purchased?**Â Original receipts or invoices that describe what was bought, ideally including the name and address of the vendor, are required. If travel is involved, detailed descriptions of each element, such as mileage to and from the destination, are required. If the expenses include a meal, there should be a list of everyone who shared the meal or you can just include the attendee list if it is a very large event in a CSV format.
    3. **When and where did the expense occur?**Â Original receipts or invoices to confirm the dates and places involved are required.
    4. **What was the business purpose of the expense?**Â A brief description of how the expense relates to Techqueria's work is required.
4. Notify `@techqueria-exec` in #meta-chapter-directors so it can be approved more quickly
5. Reimbursement will be approved or rejected

### Invoices

For stipend reimbursements (chapter directors, board members, or executive staff), you must provide an invoice.

Once you have access to Notion, you can easily create a New Invoice [using the template](https://www.notion.so/techqueriaorg/New-Invoice-d5f7d467e95947e98e21e03eeb45965b) or [view an example Invoice](https://www.notion.so/techqueriaorg/Example-Invoice-7f13d9d34dde4672947460f15508cd92).

### Deadlines

- We **recommend** submitting a reimbursement request **within a week** of paying the expense.
- All expenses are **required to be submitted within 60 days of expense**, otherwise it cannot be processed.
- If an expense is more than 30 days old old, you will need to explain why it was submitted late.

## Exceeding Chapter Budget

If chapter budget is exceeded for an event or for the entire year, **your chapter cannot ask for additional reimbursements** and requests for reimbursement will be rejected until the following year.

Any additional expenses will have to be paid out of pocket.

You are recommended to find sponsors who can offset costs.

However, we are very much against any of our volunteers or directors paying out of pocket expenses which is why we have a clear tier level system and reimbursement policy that can be followed.

## New Chapter Directors

If you just started as a new chapter director, you may not retroactively have past events you may have hosted with Techqueria reimbursed.

Only events with at least one official chapter director can be reimbursed and reimbursements cannot be made retroactively to past events that may have been organized.
