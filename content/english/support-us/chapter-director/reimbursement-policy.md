## Legal Compliance

Reimbursements made under an "accountable plan" as defined by the IRS allow Techqueria to reimburse our employees or volunteers for business-related expenses without including the expenses in their compensation, which might be subject to payroll taxes.

In addition, employees or volunteers won't have to report the payments with their taxable income.

To follow legal procedures for submitting expenses,

* Expenses must be related to our nonprofit
* Expenses must be submitted and accounted for within 60 days of incurring the expense
* Any excess reimbursement must be returned no more than 120 days after receipt

### What You Can Reimburse

* good food and drinks for attendees a the event (tacos are a good first choice ðŸ˜‰)
* transit costs to get to a conference where Techqueria has a booth
  * shared ride, parking, public transportation
* swag or materials for events
  * stickers
  * banners
  * swag
* speaker payments or fees
* fun event activity
  * photo booth
  * crafting
* thank you dinners, lunches, breakfasts, gifts, etc for chapter directors and volunteers

### What You Cannot Reimburse

* transit cost for a Techqueria event
* private dinners with partners
* stipend for chapter directors
  * chapter director roles are unpaid
* stipend for volunteers
  * volunteer roles are unpaid
* software or online platforms

## Chapter Tier Reimbursements

### Event Reimbursements

* Events must have **at least 20 people** in attendance in order to get full event reimbursement depending on chapter tier
* If the number of attendees is 50 or more, event reimbursement goes up by $1.00 for every additional person
* For events with 11 to 19 people, you can reimburse $5 per person so 11 x $5 to 19 x $5 or $55 to $95
* For events with 10 or fewer attendees, no reimbursements are provided
* Attendees can include chapter directors and speakers
* All attendance must be verified via Bevy before reimbursement is provided
* Reimbursements must only be used to cover out of pocket costs for events, must be approved through Open Collective and must adhere to the Reimbursement Policy

You can use the custom calculator below to easily see what potential reimbursement you can get.

### Misc Expenses

* Examples: Thanking volunteers through lunches or dinners, travel costs for conferences where Techqueria is a partner, extra budget for events
* Reimbursements must only be used to benefit the Techqueria chapter, must be approved through Open Collective and must adhere to the Reimbursement Policy

## Monetary Event Sponsors

If an event gets sponsored by a company and the chapter receives money, 50% of that money must go towards Techqueria but the remaining 50% can be added to the chapter budget.

For example, if the SF chapter receives a $1,000 sponsorship â€”Â $500 goes to Techqueria and $500 can go towards the SF chapter budget for event reimbursements or misc expenses.

## How to Request Reimbursement

1. Go to [https://opencollective.com/techqueria](https://opencollective.com/techqueria)
2. Sign up or login to Open Collective [https://opencollective.com](https://opencollective.com/)
3. Submit an expense and verify all 4 points below are covered:
   1. **Who incurred the expense?**Â Payment will be issued to this person.
   2. **What was purchased?**Â Original receipts or invoices that describe what was bought, ideally including the name and address of the vendor, are required. If travel is involved, detailed descriptions of each element, such as mileage to and from the destination, are required. If the expenses include a meal, there should be a list of everyone who shared the meal or you can just include the attendee list if it is a very large event in a CSV format.
   3. **When and where did the expense occur?**Â Original receipts or invoices to confirm the dates and places involved are required.
   4. **What was the business purpose of the expense?**Â A brief description of how the expense relates to Techqueria's work is required.
4. Notify `@techqueria-exec` in #meta-chapter-directors so it can be approved more quickly
5. Reimbursement will be approved or rejected

### Invoices

For any stipend reimbursements (like speaker fees), you must provide an invoice. 

You're welcome to use any invoice template as long as the 4 points above are verified.

### Deadlines

* We **recommend** submitting a reimbursement request **within a week** of paying the expense.
* All expenses are **required to be submitted within 60 days of expense**, otherwise, it cannot be processed.
  * For director stipends, it should be within 60 days of the event that was led by the director.
* If an expense is more than 30 days old, you will need to explain why it was submitted late.

## Exceeding Chapter Budget

If the chapter budget is exceeded for an event or for the entire year, **your chapter cannot ask for additional reimbursements** and requests for reimbursement will be rejected until the following year.

Any additional expenses will have to be paid out of pocket.

You are recommended to find sponsors who can offset costs.

However, we are very much against any of our volunteers or directors paying out of pocket expenses which is why we have a clear tier level system and reimbursement policy that can be followed.

## New Chapter Directors

If you just started as a new chapter director, you may not retroactively have past events you may have hosted with Techqueria reimbursed.

Only events with at least one official chapter director can be reimbursed and reimbursements cannot be made retroactively to past events that may have been organized.
