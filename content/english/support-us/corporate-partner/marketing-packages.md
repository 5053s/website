### Disclaimers

- We have a max of 4 call to actions from the same organization that can be shared per month for up to 12 months.
- We post 1 CTA across all 6 of our major social media platforms so we don't post the CTA multiple times throughout the month, just once if you purchased the 1 call to action per month package.
- We have corporate partnerships where we offer both event + marketing packages. In those types of partnerships, companies where they are responsible for providing us specific job postings if they want to promote those, otherwise we default to the general careers link.
- We haven't researched whether there is a huge difference in clicks between posting a generic career link or a specific job posting but we prefer to promote specific job postings.
- The job section in email newsletter is also dependent on if the companies provide us specific job postings and affects the format.
- We do not allow for refunds so please be sure of your purchase.
- **Techqueria has a [strict policy](/about/no-tech-for-ice/) in place to not partner with companies that have an active contract with ICE.**
