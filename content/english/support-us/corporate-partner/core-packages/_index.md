## Core Sponsorship Tiers

The primary way we partner with tech companies is through the core sponsorship packages which also include marketing add-ons depending on the tier.

We are also open to [custom packages](/support-us/corporate-partner/custom-packages/) which range from from $1,000+ to $150,000+ so there are options for companies of all sizes.

## Event Types

### Local

Our workshops and meetups allow participants to discuss their work, prepare for critical milestones in their career, establish goals and accountability through peer mentorship, and explore how to navigate our workplaces as underrepresented members of the tech industry.

### Comida

Outside our regular workshops and meetups, we often meet up and network at food gathering events that we call comidas. This is an opportunity to share our rich, diverse cultures through food and fun! Anyone in our community can organize a comida and a company can also sponsor one for up to 25 people.

### Webinar

Gain exposure to a wider audience beyond one night and be inclusive of remote employees or attendees outside our chapter locations. Through a webinar, we will stream your event through YouTube and extend your reach.

### Private

Host a private workshop or community event at your company where we discuss a specific topic. Previous topics have included coaching on executive presence and public speaking, building effective employee resource groups, and navigating the workplace as an individual contributor.
