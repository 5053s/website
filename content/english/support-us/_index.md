## Become a Sponsor

Sponsorship packages last one year and sponsors must sign a contract and provide payment before commitments start.

We are also open to custom packages but these are our base tiers.

### Sponsor booth

We will invite our Diamond sponsors to have a booth at certain Techqueria events separate from the ones hosted with the sponsor.

### Logo in slides

The sponsor logo is showcased on slides in the beginning of all Techqueria events for one year.

### Job postings

The monthly job postings are shared through the monthly email newsletter.

### Social media posts

The monthly social media posts are shared on Techqueria's Twitter, Facebook Page, LinkedIn Page and Google Business.

## Events

### Event Commitments

#### For each event, Techqueria commits to providing

- a slot for up to one speaker picked by or associated with sponsor
- an event page (hosted through Splashthat, Eventbrite, Meetup or our website)
- attendee list with job function, LinkedIn and resume
- enforcement of our Code of Conduct
- marketing for the event
- slides showcasing speakers and sponsor
- speakers from the Techqueria community
- volunteers to help with registration (if applicable)

#### For each event, the sponsor commits to providing

- A/V for slides/speakers
  - at minimum this usually translates to the ability for a speaker to have a hand held mic and display slides
- event space
  - our events usually have 100 to 300 people but we can work with all sizes
- catering (food and drinks)
  - we also require some kind of ID check so drinks are not served to those who are underage
- name tags
- security

#### Nice to haves

- at least one activity for attendees to engage in before or after the event (photo booth, crafting activity, etc)
- dedicated bar
- an intro/pitch talk by the sponsor that is up to 10 minutes

### Event Types

#### Local

Our workshops and meetups allow participants to discuss their work, prepare for critical milestones in their career, establish goals and accountability through peer mentorship, and explore how to navigate our workplaces as underrepresented members of the tech industry.

#### Comida

Outside our regular workshops and meetups, we often meet up and network at food gathering events that we call comidas. This is an opportunity to share our rich, diverse cultures through food and fun! Anyone in our community can organize a comida and a company can also sponsor one for up to 25 people.

#### Webinar

Gain exposure to a wider audience beyond one night and be inclusive of remote employees or attendees outside our chapter locations. Through a webinar, we will stream your event through YouTube and extend your reach.

#### Private

Host a private workshop or community event at your company where we discuss a specific topic. Previous topics have included coaching on executive presence and public speaking, building effective employee resource groups, and navigating the workplace as an individual contributor.

#### Other Types of Events

- 5 minute rapid style with 10+ people speaking
- 1 hour with 1 person where they are teaching something
- 1 hour panels/fireside chat
  - 3 to 6 people
  - 1 moderator

## Community Partnerships

### Conferences

Techqueria can provide visibility to your conference through social media posts, our email newsletter and by showcasing our logo on our website.

In exchange, your conference can provide our members free or discounted tickets and/or a chance to speak at your conference.
