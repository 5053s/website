There are many ways to support Techqueria in our mission to provide Latinx professionals with the resources and support that they need to thrive and become leaders in the tech industry. The primary way we partner with tech companies is through events which also include marketing add-ons depending on the tier.

## Event Sponsorship Packages

Sponsorship packages last one year and sponsors must sign a contract and provide payment before commitments start.

We are also open to [custom packages](/custom-packages/) but these are our base tiers.
