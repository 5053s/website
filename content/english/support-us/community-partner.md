> Community partners are other nonprofits or organizations that we partner with on events, digital marketing and/or affiliate marketing.

### Nonprofits

Techqueria can provide digital marketing to other nonprofit orgs in exchange for the opportunity to showcase Techqueria as a valuable resource to their Latinx members.

### Conferences

Techqueria can provide visibility to your conference through social media posts, our email newsletter and by showcasing our logo on our website.

In exchange, your conference can provide our members free or discounted tickets and/or a chance to speak at your conference.

### Affiliate Partners

Affiliate partners provide discounts for Techqueria members to go through their programs or access their content in exchange for providing Techqueria a referral fee.
