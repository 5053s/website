Community partners are other nonprofits or organizations that we partner with on events, digital marketing and affiliate marketing.

## Nonprofits

Techqueria can provide financial sponsorship, more visibility or mentors to nonprofits in exchange for access to their network and the opportunity to showcase Techqueria as a valuable resource.

## Conferences

Techqueria can provide visibility to your conference through social media posts, our email newsletter and by showcasing our logo on our website.

In exchange, your conference can provide our members free or discounted tickets and/or a chance to speak at your conference.

## Affiliate Partners

Affiliate partners provide discounts for Techqueria members to go through their programs or access their content in exchange for providing Techqueria a referral fee.
