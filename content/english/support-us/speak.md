If you are interested in supporting Techqueria as an individual, one great way to help out is by becoming a speaker for our events.

## As a speaker, you receive the opportunity to...

- improve your brand as we will be marketing your profile on our different social media platforms
- improve your public speaking skills with practice in front of large audiences (we typically get around ~250 people at our larger events)
- make new connections by letting the audience ask you questions after the talk

We can also potentially provide a speaker honorarium and Techqueria swag from the [store](/shop/) depending on our event sponsors.

## As a speaker you commit to...

- preparing in advance
- arriving on time
- syncing with the event coordinators on a call
- joining the appropriate event channel on Techqueria's [Slack](/slack)

## Fill out the form below and we'll reach out ASAP.

> Before filling out the form below, please [make sure you have already joined our Slack community](/communities/slack/) as we will be reaching out through there.
