## Core Sponsorship Tiers

{{< core-sponsorship-packages >}}

## Event Types

### Networking

Our most informal type of event are just Techqueria members gathering together to network and hang out casually. Examples include happy hours, board game nights, etc.

### Panels

Our panel events allow participants to discuss their work, prepare for critical milestones in their career, establish goals and accountability through peer mentorship, and explore how to navigate our workplaces as underrepresented members of the tech industry.

There are usually 3 to 4 panelists with 1 moderator.

### Comida

Outside our regular workshops and meetups, we often meet up and network at food gathering events that we call comidas.

This is an opportunity to share our rich, diverse cultures through food and fun!

Anyone in our community can organize a comida and a company can also sponsor one for up to 25 people.

### Virtual Event

Gain exposure to a wider audience beyond one night and be inclusive of remote employees or attendees outside our chapter locations.

Through a virtual event, we can host the event on Zoom and stream it live via YouTube or Facebook Live and extend your reach.
