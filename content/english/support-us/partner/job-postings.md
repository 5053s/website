### ROI & Metrics

We've created **[a detailed document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aZZA7UU5TsA_s_yGVZQMS10H7Nl1OKi9hYuJYRhc-3M/edit)** outlining the ROI and overall metrics for job postings on email & social media.

### Email Newsletter

Support our membersâ€™ growth with opportunities to level up in their career by engaging directly with thousands of Latinx in Tech.

### Social Media

Sharing your company with Techqueria's social media networks is a great way of reaching the Latinx in Tech community.

### Cost

We charge $100 for every job posting shared through our email newsletter or through our social media accounts.

### Process

1. You submit the form with details about job posting which includes payment
2. We reach out to confirm we received the job posting and have it scheduled on our content marketing calendar
3. We share your job posting in our email newsletter OR through social media starting the following month

### Disclaimers

- We post 1 job posting across all 6 of our major social media platforms so we don't post the job posting multiple times throughout the month, just once if you purchased the 1 job posting per month package.
- We have corporate partnerships where we offer both event + marketing packages. In those types of partnerships, companies where they are responsible for providing us specific job postings if they want to promote those, otherwise we default to the general careers link.
- We haven't researched whether there is a huge difference in clicks between posting a generic career link or a specific job posting but we prefer to promote specific job postings.
- The job section in email newsletter is also dependent on if the companies provide us specific job postings and affects the format.
- We do not allow for refunds so please be sure of your purchase.
- **Techqueria has a [strict policy](/about/no-tech-for-ice/) in place to not partner with companies that have an active contract with ICE.**
