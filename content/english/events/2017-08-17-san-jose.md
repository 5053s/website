Hola everyone!

We're excited to see you all at Cafe Stritch this week! This meetup is a great chance for us to get to know you all in a more casual environment.

For those that are new, this is a time for you to ask us questions and see what we're about. We'll also talk about what the next months may look like.

Aside from the opportunity to network with other members of Techqueria, during this event, we'll be taking the position of listeners and hope to get some feedback about what y'all would like to get out of this organization, and more specifically from South Bay events.

The schedule is pretty informal but it will go something like this:

6:45 - 7:15 | Networking

7:15 - 8:00 | Intros & Q's

8:00 - ? | Closing (and hopefully some live music!)

For those who havenâ€™t joined our Techqueria Slack check us out at https://techqueria.org/slack/

All attendees are expected to follow the code of conduct https://techqueria.org/code-of-conduct/ , and if you drink, please drink responsibly.
