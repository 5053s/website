`#ElPasoStrong`

An opportunity to come together across the nation

In light of the recent shooting in El Paso, we want to provide the opportunity for members and allies of the community to show their support by contributing to the El Paso Community Foundation fund.

Donations are not necessary to attend the event but every little bit helps show our love and support for affected families.
