Hi Frances,


I wanted to thank you for sharing the Slack group info with me. I just joined this week and find it to be such a cool, supportive community with loads of useful and interesting information!

I even found a potential candidate for the role I shared.

Just wanted to say thank you for Co-Directing such a wonderful, much-needed space for Latinx folks in tech.

Much√≠simas gracias,
Natalie Leal
