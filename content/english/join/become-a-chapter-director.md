What does it take to run a Startup Grind chapter?
Startup Grind should not take more than 20% of your time. We are looking for passionate directors that are seeking to build an awesome local community of entrepreneurs. All you must do is get an amazing speaker, a venue where to host it and define a date, every month. What really matters is the people you are bringing together in a monthly basis: the conversations and values they will share to build a thriving community of entrepreneurs in your city.

What support does Startup Grind provide?
We provide a support system and 300+ events worth of experience! Once your application is approved and accepted we will set up a one hour call to go through all of the basics needed to run your first and many other events afterwards. After the basics we will train you on our custom built software that helps you easily manage your event across three different online platforms. Along with our software we will give give you access to resources and templates that will help you conduct the very best interviews with the best speakers, lock down helpful sponsors, and most importantly communicate with a global team of other directors just like you.

Does it cost money to operate?
Most Chapters operate at a break even, if run properly. It's worth saying that the main reason why 300+ people run it in their city is not getting rich out of it. The big value will come to you in the networking and relationships you'll build - and the impact you'll have in your local ecosystem.
