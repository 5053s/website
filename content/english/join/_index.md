If you don't get an invite to our Slack community within 2 weeks, please [contact us](/contact) and let us know so we can check why you haven't received an invite yet.

## Slack Community Guidelines

As you are waiting for your invite, feel free to read through our [Slack Community Guidelines](/slack/community-guidelines/).

You can also view the latest metrics about our Slack community [using Slofile](https://slofile.com/slack/techqueria).

## Allies

We value you being a part of the Techqueria community and your interest in being an ally! To facilitate allyship, we are implementing best practices from other orgs that have been doing this type of work for a long time and adapting them to our organizational structure.

This organization exists as a space **for Latinx in tech folks** to feel included. Generally allyship in underrepresented communities is there to support the community, not the other way around. And so, while this structure is new for us as the community matures, we are firm in this policy of not allowing allies to get additional access to channels beyond the ones outlined below.

If you do not identify as Latinx, you will still receive an invitation as a multi-channel guest with access to `#announcements`, `#meta`, `#jobs` and `#allies` where you are welcome to share resources or job postings.
