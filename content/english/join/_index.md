## Member Benefits

- Access to our online Slack community where you can network with thousands of other Latinx in Tech
- Subscription to our monthly email newsletter with org updates, events, event discounts, job postings and more
- (Future) Access to our member only portal with a dedicated job board & career resources

## Aftermath

Anyone who signs up will also be subscribed to our mailing list which you can opt out of at any time.

If you don't get an invite within 2 weeks, please [contact us](/contact) and let us know so we can check why you haven't received an invite yet.

## Best Practices

As you are waiting for your invite, feel free to read through our [Slack Community Guidelines](/slack/community-guidelines/).

You can also view the latest metrics about our Slack community [using Slofile](https://slofile.com/slack/techqueria).

## Allies

If you do not identify as Latinx, you will still receive an invitation as a multi-channel guest with access to `#announcements`, `#meta`, `#jobs` and `#allies` where you are welcome to share resources or job postings.
