## Aftermath

Anyone who signs up will also be subscribed to our mailing list which you can opt out of at any time.

You should get an invite within 2 weeks.

If you don't get an invite by then, please [contact us](/contact).

## Best Practices

As you are waiting for your Slack invite, feel free to read through our [Slack Community Guidelines](/slack/community-guidelines/).

You can also view the latest metrics about our Slack community [using Slofile](https://slofile.com/slack/techqueria).

## Allies

If you do not identify as Latinx, you will still receive an invitation as a multi-channel guest with access to `#announcements`, `#meta`, `#jobs` and `#allies` where you are welcome to share resources or job postings.
