## Overview

As many of us are aware, technology plays an ever increasing role in our society and it is vital that our community has a voice in the decisions that are made.

Techqueria’s mission is to advance Latinx professionals within the tech industry. If we are successful in our mission, we will have people at the top with a seat at the table.

As of now, there aren’t many of us within these companies making these decisions, but the decisions impact everyone from our communities back home.

We want to take a moment to talk about how this impacts Techqueria as an organization.

One of the ways we generate revenue as a nonprofit is by partnering with tech companies on events and digital marketing.

This puts us in a situation where we must decide if it’s better for the community to work with companies that impact our members.

Do we try to increase representation so these decisions are made more equitably or do we refuse a partnership based on a company’s track record?

This is especially difficult because partnerships bring in resources that enables Techqueria to grow and advance our mission.

This is where our values come in:

1. Community First
2. Radical Inclusion
3. Over Communication
4. Positive Vibes
5. Data-Driven

Our highest value is being community-first and in order for values to have meaning, we must apply them to actions.

In particular, this translates Techqueria’s firm policy that  we will not partner with companies who are known to work with and support ICE.

ICE’s agenda and efforts have directly torn apart families, harmed children, violated human rights and actively support a racist agenda.

Leaders of tech companies NEED to recognize there are consequences when they make these kinds of deals.

These companies support ICE because they only care about their bottom line and don’t consider or care enough about the impact their support has on our communities.

Many of our members and their families suffer due to the abusive actions of ICE and Techqueria has even had one of our own volunteers, [Carlos Martinez](https://tucson.com/news/local/tucsonan-among-first-to-receive-daca-protection-now-detained-after/article_a02ac0a4-5f4e-55aa-b097-be94921784bb.html), detained by ICE.

While it’s unrealistic to think statements like ours will change their policies, we want to send an important message to those working for these companies that this is not okay.

We hope that as our community grows, statements like these will carry more weight and empower action and lasting change.
