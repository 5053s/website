## Social Media

You can message us via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Techqueria ) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/techqueriaorg).

We are less responsive to direct messages on other social media platforms so it may take longer to get back to you.

## Interested in sharing job opportunities?

You can [purchase a marketing package](/support-us/corporate-partner/marketing-packages/) for job opportunities.

You're also welcome to join [our Slack](/slack/) and share job postings for free in the `#jobs` channel.

## Interested in partnering with us?

We're always looking for [partners and sponsors](/support-us/) to help move our mission forward!

## Want to meet in person?

You're more than welcome to meet local chapter directors in person through one of our [upcoming events](https://events.techqueria.org/virtual-webinars/) that take place across our various chapters.

You can check out our different [communities](/communities/) for links to our social media groups and to keep informed on what we're doing.
