Most /dev/color events take place in space generously donated by technology companies in the area. Our events are a great opportunity to support our members' growth and advancement while giving them a glimpse of the environment at your company. The events vary in the number of attendees, from a handful to hundreds of engineers. Most events are on weekday evenings from 6PM to 9PM. We ask that the host company provide the following:

Logistical support in preparing the venue and signing in guests

Appetizers and/or dinner for the group of attendees

An engineering or company leader to welcome the group and share a few words about the company.
