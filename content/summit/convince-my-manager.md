Hi [INSERT YOUR MANAGER'S NAME HERE],

I would like to request time off to attend a few sessions that are of interest to me at Techqueria's #LHM Summit 2020 from October 7th to 9th.

Techqueria is a 501c3 nonprofit that serves the largest community of Latinx professionals in the tech industry within the US.

Techqueria's #LHM Summit is an event during Latinx Heritage Month created to empower Latinx professionals in tech, connect them with companies who are committed to inclusion and to celebrate the thriving Latinx in tech community.

As an attendee, I will have the opportunity to network, engage in meaningful dialogue with Latinx in tech leaders, and contribute to the growing Techqueria community across the country.

This event will allow me to tune into various sessions that appeal me throughout the day including interactive panels, workshops, keynote speakers and significant networking opportunities.

You can find the full agenda on their website: https://techqueria.org/summit.

This yearâ€™s virtual event features the following keynote speakers:

- TBA

- TBA

Attendance is free for all attendees, and I'm confident I'll be able to get a lot of benefit from attending. As a result of attending this event, I intend to strengthen my skills in [INSERT SKILLS HERE].

After attending the summit, I'd be happy to share the takeaways with during a team sync.

Let me know what you think!
